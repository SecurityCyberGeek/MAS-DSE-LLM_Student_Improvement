To solve the problem, you need to create a linear depreciation equation using the points (2020, 20000) and (2025, 8000). The slope is calculated as m = (8000 - 20000) / (2025 - 2020) = -12000 / 5 = -2400. Plugging into the point-slope form: y - 20000 = -2400(x - 2020), setting y = 0, and solving for x gives x = 2028.
