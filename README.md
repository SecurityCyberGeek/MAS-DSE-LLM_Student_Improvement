# MAS DSE Cohort 10 - Using LLMs to Improve Student Outcomes

This project is to determine how many students use the AI tutor and if those students do better than the students who used Traditional Instruction. The following explains how to use this repository for any course. This repository is designed to help cleanup the data from any course (UC San Diego's MATH 3B is used here), then do a comparison on the data to understand both groups (AI and Non-AI), and finish with the tools to make the visualizations. These visualizations are the main point of the project to show the comparisons of the data.
